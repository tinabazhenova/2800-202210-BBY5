This assignment is 100% complete.

We have accomplished all the requirements, including the chat system that was optional, for the 4 milestones.

Things left out by intention:
	- CrossIt does not support online play thus no chat box or room code are provided
	- Media queries support 2 sizes: 750px and smaller, or 751px and bigger as per COMP2800 mobile requirements

All functions:

	- Our goal with this app is closing the gap between generations with minigames that use generational terms
	- You can create a room by clicking one of the three game options in the main menu - GuessIt, MatchIt, CrossIt
	- Join an existing room that another user created by entering the room's room code (in this case you will need to ask them the code)
	- In a room users can send and receive chat messages
	- Games are playable online at https://genwe-2.herokuapp.com/
	- You earn points by playing games to the end
	- Spend these points at shop by purchasing upgrade coupons
	- Coupons are used to upgrade your title on the profile page
	- Titles are cosmetic achievements that go before your username whenever you send a chat message
	- On the profile page, upload your profile image, or remove it and set it to default
	- You can see your user information on the table in the middle
	- Change your username and password by clicking them on the table
	- If you used an admin username and password to log in, you will see an extra button on the main page that leads you to the admin dashboard
	- Here you can do all the CRUD operations on other users
